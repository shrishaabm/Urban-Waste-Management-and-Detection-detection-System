# Urban Waste Management and Detection detection System

Welcome to the Garbage Detection Website! This project aims to help keep our streets clean by using machine learning to detect garbage from photos uploaded by users.

## Features

- **Upload Photos**: Users can take a photo of garbage on the street and upload it to the website.
- **Garbage Detection**: The uploaded photo is processed by a YOLO-based machine learning model via FastAPI to classify if there is garbage or not.
- **Database Storage**: The system stores the image, latitude, longitude, and the true/false result in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Map Integration**: If garbage is detected, a marker is placed on a map using the Leaflet API, indicating the presence of garbage.
- **Interactive Map**: Users can view locations with detected garbage on an interactive map, making it easier to identify areas that need cleaning.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
